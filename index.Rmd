# **Game of Thrones Ratings Per Episode Per Season**

## **Background and Research Question**

## **Data**
Write something about where I got the data from.

### Load Packages

```{r loadlib, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse) #for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis
library(here) #simplifies paths
library(readxl) #to read excel files in R
library(knitr) #runs the R code and inserts the results back into the document
library(dplyr) #for data manipulation tasks
library(ggimage) #to add images to the legend
```

### Import the Data

```{r import}
#load data from excel file
rawdata <- read_excel(here::here("raw_data", "raw_data.xlsx"))

#this is a sanity check to inspect the data
print(rawdata)

```

### Wrangle the Data

```{r wrangle, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#rename the first column after automatic assignment of "...1"
colnames(rawdata) <- ifelse(colnames(rawdata) == "...1", "Season", colnames(rawdata))

#rename the columns, excluding the first, empty column
colnames(rawdata)[-1] <- c("Episode 1", "Episode 2", "Episode 3", "Episode 4", "Episode 5", "Episode 6", "Episode 7", "Episode 8", "Episode 9", "Episode 10", "Episode 11")

#this is a sanity to check to make sure the column headers changed
head(rawdata)

#change the values in the first column
rawdata$Season <- sub("s", "", rawdata$Season) #removing the 's' just to clean up to view of the table.

#render the table with kable
kable(rawdata, format = "markdown")
 
```

Write something here about why episode 11 is being excluded. i.e. episode 11 on IMDB is in the data but it was an unaired pilot episode.

```{r cleaning}
# Reshape the data to long format for a more flexible structure for visualizing, analyzing, and modeling data. This is easier for ggplot2 to handle.
rawdata_long <- rawdata %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Episode"),  # Select columns that start with "Episode"
               names_to = "Episode",           # Create a new column "Episode"
               values_to = "Rating")          # Create a new column "Rating"

# Exclude Episode 11 from the data
data <- rawdata_long %>%
  filter(str_replace(Episode, "Episode ", "") != "11")

#this is a sanity check to make sure the data is now in a long format
head(data)

# Save the data as a CSV file, which can be opened in excel.
write.csv(data, "data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## **Visualisation**

```{r basic visualisation, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Create a basic line plot with minimal customisation
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = as.integer(str_replace(Episode, "Episode ", "")),  # Convert episode to numeric
                         y = Rating, 
                         color = factor(Season))) +  # Use Season for different lines
  geom_line() +                        # Draw lines
  geom_point() +                       # Add points for each episode
  labs(x = "Episode Number",            # Label for x-axis
       y = "Episode Rating",            # Label for y-axis
       color = "Season Number") +       # Label for the legend
  theme_minimal() +                    # Use a minimal theme for a clean look
  scale_color_viridis_d() +             # Add color scale for different lines
  theme(legend.position = "right")      # Place the legend at the right

#view the plot as a sanity check to assess what direction to take the customisations.
print(p)

```
```{r customised visualisation, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Preprocess the Episode column to extract numeric episode numbers. It removes the "Episode " part of the string and converts the remaining number (e.g., "1", "2") into an integer; creating a new column 'EpisodeNumber'
data1 <- data %>%
  mutate(EpisodeNumber = as.integer(str_replace(Episode, "Episode ", "")))

#this is a sanity check to view the new column
print(data1)

# Create the plot
p1 <- ggplot(data1, aes(x = EpisodeNumber,  # Use preprocessed EpisodeNumber
                      y = Rating, 
                      color = factor(Season))) +  
  geom_line() +                        
  geom_point() +                       
  labs(x = "Episode Number",            
       y = "Episode Rating",            
       color = "Season Number") +       
  theme_minimal() +                    # Use a minimal theme for a clean look
  scale_color_viridis_d() +             # Add color scale for different lines
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, max(data1$EpisodeNumber), by = 1)) +  # Set x-axis breaks to 1
   scale_y_continuous(
   breaks = seq(4, 10, by = 0.5),  # Set y-axis breaks from 4 to 10.5 in steps of 0.5
    limits = c(4, 10),              # Set y-axis limits to go from 4 to 10.5
    expand = c(0, 0)                  # Remove extra padding around the axis
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")      

# Display the plot
print(p1)
