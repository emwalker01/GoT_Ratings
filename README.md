# PSY6422 Project
Project for 'Data Analysis and Visualisation' module that analyses Game of Thrones Ratings per episode per season.

Thanks for checking out my github page! 

This project was created to explore trends within Game of Thrones episode ratings. It aims to look at such as whether ratings increased or decreased over the course of the show, or whether there were any significant drops after key plot developments, for example.

If you would like to see this project, check the webpage (the link is available through this repo).
If you would like to take this analysis forward, the data files and code used for this project are also available in this repo
