# PSY6422 Project - Game of Thrones Episode Ratings Per Season
Thank you for checking out my github page!

This is my project for the 'Data Analysis and Visualisation' module of my Master's degree. The project explores episode ratings throughout the seasons of the globally renowned television series Game of Thrones. The aim of the analysis is to investigate trends and anomalies in the episode ratings and to understand how the episode ratings have evolved across the seasons.

The purpose of this code was to learn basic data analysis techniques and to develop my coding abilities.
